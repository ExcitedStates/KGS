The init pdbs is the A-chain from PDB entry 4ake, the open configuration of
Adenylate Kinase (ADK). The target_aligned.pdb is PDB 1ake, the closed configuration of ADK. Either use init.kgs.pdb with KGS directly (it includes hydrogen bonds), or the combination of init.pdb as input structure and hBonds.txt as constraints
(these are limited to the intersection between open and closed ADK).
Hydrophobics are included in the init_withHydrophobics.kgs.pdb

Various examples are given in the rigidity, dCCRRT, randomSampling, or hierarchy folders.

Rigidity:
- compute rigid cluster decomposition based on nullspace modes 
 --> output pymol file, color by b factor


Hierarchy/free energy modes:
- ensemble from sampling 10 modes with lowest free energy
--> output: create ensemble from structures, run rmsf_states in pymol
For more details, check out the hierarchy repo

dCCRRT:
- motion planning with dCCRRT --> with ~10,000 - 20,000 samples, dCCRRT finds a close transition pathway between open and closed starting structures
- dCC residue networks for insights into allostery
